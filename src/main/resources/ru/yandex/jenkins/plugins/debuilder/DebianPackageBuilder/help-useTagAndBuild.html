<div>Search for tags on SCM in the format 'v[a-zA-Z.~]+' and
	append the sequential build number '+build.1'. The build version will
	be reset every time a new major version is found. If you change the
	debian path your build version maybe will reset too, for more details
	see the debian path's help.</div>
